# Hotdog Deep learning model
It is a deep learning model trained with Keras and the TensorFlow framework on the Saturn Cloud. This model is put together to recognize hotdogs in any restaurant's serving logic. This is a binary classification model that recognizes hotdogs or not.

# Project goals 
* To differentiate between "hot dog" and "not hot dog" images, train a Deep learning model.
* Use various datasets to ensure the model works effectively on unknown data.
* To minimize computation time without sacrificing accuracy.
* Use the pre-trained model as Transfer learning.

# Project Objectives
## Data Collection & Preprocessing
* Gather dataset of hot dog and non-hot dog images.
* Resize and normalize images for consistent model input.
* Apply data augmentation (flipping left, right, horizontally, and vertically) for performance improvement and robustness.

## Model Training & Evaluation
* Use python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, numpy, and MatplotLib.
* Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) model, Xception trained on ImageNet.
* Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Iteration & Fine-tuning
* Experiment with hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, dropout).
* Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
* Use Transfer Learning to leverage pre-trained models.
